Ok so basically...
The translator has a box class which creates a pop up window with javax swing, and can take in input. It sends the input to an
overarching method in the utility class which combines all of the methods in the utility class.
These methods break the input down into a String[] holding separate words by finding the positions of all spaces
(and inserting a space after every line drop), sending these words one at a time to the translate class to be translated,
and then reassembling the returned String[] into a single output, which is sent back to the box to be outputted.
The translator class has one overarching method which combines all of the methods in the translator and punctuation classes to
translate a single word. It first stores the punctuation at the end and beginning of words with the findStart and findEnd
punctuation methods, checks for line drops with the lineDrop method, and then removeStart and removeEnd punctuation methods remove
the punctuation (we need 4 functions instead of 2 because each function can only return one value, and we don't want to create a
class object for each word). Then the word is translated with the translate method and the punctuation/line drops are readded.
There is also a method for if two words separated by dashes/slashes (like that) are sent in. Thats all folks!
